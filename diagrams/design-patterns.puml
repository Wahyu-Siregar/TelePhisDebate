component "Rule-Based Triage" as Triage
component "Single-Shot LLM\n(LLM as Router)" as Router
component "Multi-Agent Debate\n(Orchestration)" as MAD
component "Agents x3\n(Parallelization)" as Agents
component "Round 2 Deliberation\n(Reflect & Critique)" as Reflect
component "Voting Aggregator" as Aggregator
component "Actions" as Actions

Triage --> Router : risk signal
Router --> Actions : finalize decision
Router --> MAD : escalate when ambiguous

MAD --> Agents : round 1 analyze (parallel)
Agents --> Reflect : share arguments
Reflect --> Agents : revise stance
Agents --> Aggregator : votes
Aggregator --> Actions : final decision

note right of Router : Pattern: LLM-as-router
note right of Agents : Pattern: parallelization
note right of Reflect : Pattern: reflect-and-critique
note right of MAD : Pattern: multi-agent orchestration
